## Doctoral Admissions

##### How do you assess PhD applications?

Our evaluation of new applications is grounded in three key criteria:

1. Academic Excellence: Applicants must possess a degree with distinction in an engineering discipline.
2. Research Interests Compatibility: Your research interests should closely match our current research focus and priorities.
3. Innovation: You should be able to demonstrate your potential to contribute to the field of SNN and its applications.

##### What are your current research priority areas?

A non-exhaustive list of topics that we are currently interested in is as follows:

1. Spiking neural networks and their applications
2. Spike Camera and its downstream applications
3. Brain-inspired computing and its scientific potential

Our list of [recent papers](/papers/) might provide you with further ideas regarding potential research topics that are currently of interest to our group.


##### Where to check your admission files and policy?

Please refer to the [admission policy](https://admission.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) for more information.
