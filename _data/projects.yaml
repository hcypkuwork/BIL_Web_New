  description: >
    We are developing a data-driven model to simulate the interactions between the C. elegans brain, body, and environment. The model is based on the principles of neuroscience and computational neuroscience, and is used to study the behavior of the C. elegans.

    The important innovation of BAAIWorm Tianbao lies in that it not only focuses on the modeling of the nervous system, but also takes the body and the environment into consideration, forming a closed - loop system. By simulating the behavior of nematodes, it explores how the neural structure affects intelligent behavior. This work not only provides a new platform for the study of biological intelligence, but also lays the foundation for the further development of the embodied intelligence theory and its application in the field of artificial intelligence.

    Padraig Gleeson from University College London (member of the OpenWorm team and one of the reviewers of this paper) evaluated BAAIWorm as follows: "This is a remarkable achievement. It integrates the physiological and anatomical information of Caenorhabditis elegans into a computational model. It shows a lot of progress at different levels, and all the achievements are integrated with each other, forming a clear picture. I think this is an important advance in our modeling of Caenorhabditis elegans and understanding the 'brain - body - environment' interaction."

# - title: Sentiment Analysis of Commodity Markets Using Transformer-based Language Models
#   image: images/projects/lng-carrier.jpg
#   description: >
#     Working in close collaboration with our partners in the Faculty of Finance at Dauphine University we are developing a LLM-based apprach to assess commodity supply and demand market sentiment from news articles. The methodology developed represents a significant improvement upon current approaches with applicability across a diverse range of commodities. Our model seeks to identify subtle market signals and sentiment indicators that conventional methods often miss, providing traders and supply chain analysts with additional insights for decision-making.

# - title: Vision-Language-Action Models for AV Scenario Interpretation
#   image: images/projects/vla-elm.jpg
#   description: >
#     TSL is working with Elm Europe, the UK-based subsidiary of Elm Company, a leading Saudi technology group, to develop a visual-language-action model framework for the next generation of autonomous vehicle safety systems. Using multi-modal foundation models, the model can interpret unique situations that AVs may have to encounter, and respond to potential safety hazards in real-time. The project builds on our earlier work on AV simulation and risk metrics, which will be complemented by the VLA framework for real-time decision-making.

# - title: Scalable Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management
#   image: images/komatsu_project.jpg
#   description: We are collaborating with Komatsu Ltd. to develop advanced algorithms for the optimal dispatching of autonomous trucks in open-pit mines. This project integrates reinforcement learning with combinatorial optimisation to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in mining operations. Building on our team’s expertise in simulation-driven optimisation and autonomous vehicle safety, the research aims to establish decentralised control policies that can be deployed at scale across large autonomous truck fleets.

#   image: images/projects/deepsafe.jpg
#   description: >
#     TSL participates in the DeepSafe consortium, a CCAV-funded initiative ethat addresses critical barriers to autonomous vehicle deployment. Our primary contribution focuses on developing a unified risk assessment framework that quantifies the multidimensional nature of AV risk factors, building on our research in the Autonomy, Construction and Maritime sectors.

# - title: Scenario Gym - Lightweight Autonomous Driving Simulation
#   image: images/projects/scenariogym.png
#   description: >
#     TSL collaborated with dRisk.ai and Hitachi to develop Scenario Gym, a lightweight autonomous driving simulation model that can execute unconfined, complex scenarios with diverse road users. Scenario Gym is built using Python and utilises an in-memory scenario representation compatible with OpenSCENARIO and OpenDRIVE standards. It is built with extensibility in mind and can support both predefined trajectories and intelligent self-controlling entities with high-level goals.
