## 22530013 – NeuroAI：从脑科学到类脑智能
_Collage of AI, First Term &nbsp; (2025 - 2026)_ 


{% capture text_NeuroAI %}

The human brain's trillion-synapse architecture dwarfs even ChatGPT's 175 billion parameters in complexity. How does such a biological network generate intelligence, and what can it teach us about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)? This course "NeuroAI: From Brain Science to Brain-Inspired Intelligence" investigates the cutting-edge intersection between neural computation and bio-inspired AI. Starting with neuronal models and neural coding principles, it systematically explores biological mechanisms in sensory systems and higher cognition, while emphasizing their translation into brain-inspired algorithms like spiking neural networks and memory models. Through lectures, computational tools, and critical discussions, students will master methodologies bridging biological and artificial intelligence, laying foundations for AGI research. Designed for advanced students with mathematical/programming backgrounds who are passionate about neuroscience-AI integration.
